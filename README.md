# Run Streamlit.io on Google Cloud Kubernetes
<p>I'm a massive advocate of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.streamlit.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamlit</a>. Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. Streamlit allows you to develop beautiful apps without needing a tools team. But when your app becomes a standard within an organization, how do you scale it, secure and minimize the complexity of managing a deployment workflow.</p>


<p>Streamlit abstracts the tools teams, and Google Cloud with Kubernetes, Identity Aware Proxy (IAP), and an external HTTP(S) Load Balancer will scale, and secure the Streamlit application.</p>
